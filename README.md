This project presents a web application designed to optimize local store management and enhance customer convenience through intelligent pre-ordering and time allocation. The platform caters to two primary stakeholders: Customers and Retailers. Customers can seamlessly browse products, place orders, and select preferred pickup times, while retailers efficiently manage inventory, receive orders, and confirm time slots. The core innovation lies in the use of a Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based time allocation system that dynamically prioritizes orders based on customer purchase frequency, order value, urgency, and store capacity. This approach ensures optimal order distribution, minimizing bottlenecks and maximizing operational efficiency.
The system provides real-time notifications to both customers and retailers, maintaining transparency and enhancing user experience. The workflow encompasses user registration and authentication, product browsing, order placement, intelligent time slot allocation, order processing, real-time notifications, and customer feedback collection. The application is developed using the MERN stack: React.js for a dynamic frontend, Node.js with Express.js for backend logic, and MongoDB for flexible data management. Real-time updates are facilitated through WebSockets or Firebase, ensuring instant communication. The platform is designed to be scalable and is hosted on cloud services such as AWS, Vercel, or Firebase. This strategic integration of technologies and intelligent time management enhances customer convenience while optimizing operational workflows for retailers.
